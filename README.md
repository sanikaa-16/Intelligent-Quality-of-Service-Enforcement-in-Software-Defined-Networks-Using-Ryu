# Intelligent-Quality-of-Service-Enforcement-in-Software-Defined-Networks-Using-Ryu

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller using the RYU framework that dynamically enforces Quality of Service (QoS) policies based on real-time traffic classification. The controller integrates a machine learning model to classify network flows and assigns them to appropriate priority queues at runtime.

Unlike static QoS mechanisms, this system continuously monitors live traffic statistics, adapts to changing flow behavior, and enforces network policies without restarting active flows.

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of a Mininet-based network topology connected to an Open vSwitch (OVS) instance managed by a RYU controller. The controller periodically polls flow statistics, extracts traffic features, performs ML-based classification, and dynamically updates flow rules to enforce QoS.

---

## Key Features

- Dynamic QoS enforcement using OpenFlow
- Machine learning-based traffic classification
- Periodic flow statistics polling
- Runtime flow reclassification and queue reassignment
- Hysteresis mechanism to prevent queue oscillations
- Automatic cleanup of inactive flows
- Scalable and stable controller design

---

## Machine Learning Model

- Model: Random Forest Classifier  
- Training: Offline (pre-trained model loaded at runtime)
- Features:
  - Packet count
  - Byte count
  - Flow duration
  - Throughput
  - Packet rate
- Output Classes:
  - High priority traffic
  - Medium priority traffic
  - Best-effort traffic

The trained model is loaded into the controller at startup and used during each polling interval.

## Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mininet openvswitch-switch iperf python3-pip
pip3 install ryu scikit-learn joblib matplotlib
Running the Controller
ryu-manager ryu_qos_controller.py
Expected output includes successful model loading and installation of the table-miss flow entry.
Running Mininet
sudo mn --topo single,3 --controller remote --switch ovs
Generating Traffic
h3 iperf -s &
h1 iperf -c h2 -u -b 25M -t 20
During traffic generation, the controller dynamically classifies flows and assigns queues based on predicted traffic priority.

## Traffic Generation Scenarios (Queue-wise Testing)

The following steps describe how different traffic patterns were generated to trigger specific QoS queues. Each scenario must be cleaned up properly before starting the next one.

---

### Q0 – Best Effort (Bulk TCP Traffic)

1. **Start Server**
```bash
h2 iperf -s &
````

2. **Start Client (run for 15 seconds)**

```bash
h1 iperf -c h2 -t 15
```

3. **Cleanup (Important)**

```bash
h1 killall iperf
h2 killall iperf
```

---

### Q1 – Interactive / Low-Latency Traffic (Gaming-like TCP)

1. **Start Listener**

```bash
h2 nc -l -p 5001 -k &
```

2. **Start Client (run for ~15 seconds, then stop)**

```bash
h1 python3 -c "import socket,time; s=socket.socket(); s.connect(('10.0.0.2',5001)); [ (s.send(b'x'*80), time.sleep(0.05)) for i in iter(int,1) ]" &
```

3. **Cleanup**

```bash
h1 killall python3
h2 killall nc
```

---

### Q2 – Streaming / Multimedia Traffic (UDP)

1. **Start UDP Server**

```bash
h2 iperf -s -u &
```

2. **Start Video Client (2 Mbps for 15 seconds)**

```bash
h1 iperf -c h2 -u -b 2M -t 15
```

3. **Cleanup**

```bash
h1 killall iperf
h2 killall iperf
```

---

## Running `morph_ultimate.py`

This script generates mixed traffic patterns to evaluate dynamic queue reassignment and controller stability.

1. **Kill Old Listeners**

```bash
h2 killall nc
```

2. **Start TCP Listener (Silent)**

```bash
h2 nc -l -p 5001 -k > /dev/null &
```

3. **(Optional) Start UDP Listener (Silent)**

```bash
h2 nc -l -u -p 5001 -k > /dev/null &
```

4. **Run Traffic Generator**

```bash
mininet> h1 python3 morph_ultimate.py
```

The controller dynamically classifies flows generated by the script and assigns them to appropriate QoS queues in real time.

## Results and Observations
High-priority flows consistently achieve higher throughput
QoS enforcement adapts dynamically to traffic behavior
Hysteresis mechanism prevents frequent queue switching
Stable controller behavior observed during extended runs
No packet loss due to controller-driven flow updates
Traffic analysis scripts can be used to generate throughput and queue-wise performance graphs.

## Future Work
Online learning and adaptive model updates
Multi-switch and multi-path topology support
Latency and jitter-aware classification
Integration with NFV-based services
Real-time visualization dashboard
